================================================================================
	
Note for some reason some card images throw a 400 HTTP Error.

Whenever this happens the program will ask you if you want to continue with or 
without the picture. If you choose to keep the picture a folder will be created
"tmp\<cardname>\", in which you need to place the image yourself. Hit enter in 
the Program to continue.
